# ParrotNotify

A shell script that sends a notification with the [Terminal parrot](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot).
This script is guaranteed to have bad practices, low quality code and regrettable choices all over it and minimal amount of care has been put into it to ensure the best experience possible.
Good luck making this work!
